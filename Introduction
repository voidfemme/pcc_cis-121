Introduction
Body
	A brief history of keyboards.
		The Teletype printer was the predecessor to the 
		 keyboard as we know it.
	The physical mechanisms.
		Keys and switches
		Matrices and circuits
		on-board microcontroller
	The software
		Operating Systems use what is essentially a Teletype
		 emulator in order to parse the scancodes when it
		 recieves the scancode from the keyboard.
		After that, it hands it off to what is known as the
		 user space
		 	User space vs Kernel Space
			 volatile memory dedicated to running 
			 applications. 
			 	"Separating user space from kernel 
			 	space protects the system from errant processes 
			 	that could use up memory required by the 
			 	operating system (OS). The result is a more 
			 	stable system where memory leaks and program 
			 	crashes do not affect the OS." ()
